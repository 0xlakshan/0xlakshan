Hi 👋 I'm [Lakshan Perera](https://0xlakshan.github.io)
-----------------
AI Engineer from Sri Lanka. I spend most of my time building & contributing to open source tools like [ai-sdk](https://github.com/vercel/ai) and [gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), mainly focused on improving the developer experience around AI. 

You can find my main personal projects below they explore some unique areas that haven’t really been solved yet and could make the dev experience a lot better. 

If you're interested in collaborating, email is the best way to reach me i check it pretty often [lakshanperera.dev@gmail.com](mailto:lakshanperera.dev@gmail.com).
